"""KYC — Customer Identification Program (CIP) only.

Verifies name / DOB / address / SSN against the bureau, then stops.

MISSING (deliberately, for now):
  - OFAC / sanctions screening
  - beneficial-owner (UBO) identification for entity applicants
  - ongoing monitoring
  - SAR path
An LLC can clear this with no real person verified.

This logic used to live inside origination-service (app/kyc.py); it is now its own
kyc-service. Splitting it into a standalone service did NOT close the gap — the CIP-only
story (no sanctions/OFAC, no UBO, no ongoing monitoring, no SAR) is carried forward intact.
