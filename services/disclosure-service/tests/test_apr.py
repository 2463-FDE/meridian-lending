"""APR money-math tests.

These currently FAIL because apr.py uses float and a crude annualization. CI runs them
with continue-on-error so the build stays green. (This is the W4 discovery material.)

DELIBERATELY-FAILING by design — documents debt D1 (float money math breaching the Reg Z
APR tolerance) and D6 (the three drifted ORIGINATION_FEE_PCT copies). Do not "fix".
